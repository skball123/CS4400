Currently, this website is only for demonstration purposes, but could be readily scaled into a 
full application. Students can sign up for tutoring for any classes that they are enrolled in.
They simply enter the times that they are available and then a list is populated with available tutors.
Students can also rate their tutors. Professors are able to provide tutor recommendations and ratings.
Administrators can generate reports that provide data regarding tutoring for each semester and class.

The page will prompt you for your time availabilities. You can click the Day to Cycle through the weekdays, 
or use the drop down to select the time of day. Clicking Add Time will dynamically insert another field.
Put in Monday at 12, Monday at 1, and Wednesday at 12, and whatever other times you want.
This will populate a list of available tutors at that time along with their average rating number of reviews.
You can click the green schedule button to pop up a modal for time slot selection, or click the rate button
to review the tutor.
